Introduction
We are starting a new project Care6. 
The aim of this project is to setup and manage a postgreSQL database 
hosted on the Google Cloud.

The datebase is already set up. 
We need to create a Factory introducing Blueprint

Under the /app directory we have following directories with functionality:
db_connection = connction to the postgreSQL
db_creation = creating db schema, tables, cloumns
login = login functions
data_input = get data from input forms
data output = fetchin and displaying data from database
admin = access, correction, extending database, etc functions

pls advise step by step proccess. if possible in small steps that I can catch up. Thanks
